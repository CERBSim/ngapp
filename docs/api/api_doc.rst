API Documentation
=================

This section contains the Python API reference for NGApp. It is useful when
you want to look up available classes, functions, and component options in
detail.

The API is organised into the following parts:

* :doc:`components/qcomponents` – auto-generated wrappers for Quasar components
  (buttons, inputs, layouts, dialogs, and more).
* Component modules – helper components, base component and specialised
  widgets built on top of Quasar and HTML elements:

  - :doc:`Visualization components <components/visualization>`
  - :doc:`Material components <components/material>`
  - :doc:`Helper components <components/helper_components>`
  - :doc:`Base component <components/basecomponent>`
* :doc:`utils` – general utility functions used when working with files,
  environments, and other NGApp internals.

If you are just getting started, you usually do not need to read the full
API reference. Start with :doc:`../getting_started`, :doc:`../components`, and
the :doc:`../tutorials` first, then return here when you need finer details.
